# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 🚀 Objective
This project aims to perform a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between passenger features and their likelihood of survival. Using both statistical tests and data visualizations, the project identifies key factors that influenced survival outcomes.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Passenger Class**: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate (~56%)
- **Fare**: Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive
- **Family Size**: Smaller families (1–2 members) showed better survival odds
- **Age**: Survivors were slightly younger on average
- **Significant Features**: `Pclass`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, and `Parch` were all statistically significant in relation to survival
